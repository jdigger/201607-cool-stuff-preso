== val "`gotchas`"

* Relies on type-inference from the right-side, whereas other parts of modern
  Java type-inference take it from the left
  ** `Map<String, File> cache = new HashMap<>();`
  ** `Function<String, File> cacheFun = cache::get;`
* `val` currently https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/911[does not
work inside lambdas], so you need to extract the code out to a method
  ** Arguably, if the code is complicated enough (i.e., more than a single
     expression) to need an intermediate variable, it should be extracted into
     a method anyway


== JDK 8

== Streams & Lambdas

== Some Things To Realize About Streams

* They are single-use only, like `Iterator`
* They're monads, so all the really, **_really_** useful characteristics
  of monads apply from functional programming

== First a REALLY Simple Look at Monads

Monads, Functors, etc. are fancy ways of saying "`a value that is expressed
as a function.`"

A monad, specifically, needs `map(i -> o)` and `flatMap(i -> M{o})` functions.

[.em07]
--
```java
public interface Stream<T> {
    <R> Stream<R> map(Function<T, R> mapper);
    <R> Stream<R> flatMap(Function<T, Stream<R>> mapper);
}
```
--

== Monad Use

What that means is that you can transform that value in extremely
flexible/powerful ways regardless of such things as:

* it contains a single value or a many
* the value exists at all (e.g., `Optional.empty()`)
* the value doesn't exist **_yet_** (e.g., asynchronous)
* the complete value doesn't fit into process space
* it's infinite
* different modes of computation (e.g., serial or concurrent)
* etc.

== Monad "`Extractions`"

* A pure monad doesn't expose its innards, like the SchrÃ¶dinger's cat box.
* As long as it's pure, it can retain all those properties.
* When you "`extract`" from the monad (reach into the box) is when the computation machinery kicks in.

== Monad Reading

There's a **_LOT_** of stuff explaining monads, monoids, functors,
endofunctions, etc. Just Google it.

The best I've found for explaining it in Java code instead of mathematics
notation is http://www.nurkiewicz.com/2016/06/functor-and-monad-examples-in-plain-java.html[Functor
and monad examples in plain Java]

== Streams as Monads

* Try to keep Streams "`pure`" as much as possible.
* There's effectively zero cost to them (computational, memory, etc.) until
  you do a "`terminal`" operation that destroys that purity.
* At times it seems like `Stream` doesn't want you to have it as a `Collection`
  or the like, making you have to jump through some hoops. That's not by accident...


== Extracting from Streams - findAny and collect

[.em065]
--
```java
public @Nullable HostJobState put(HostJobState entry) {
    val existing = entries().stream().
        filter(e -> match(e, entry)).
        findAny().orElse(null);

    if (existing == null || !existing.state().equals(entry.state())) {
        if (existing == null) { // new entry
            this.hostJobStates = new ArrayList<>(entries());
            hostJobStates.add(entry);
        }
        else { // modified entry
            hostJobStates = entries().stream().
                map(e -> match(e, entry) ? entry : e).
                collect(Collectors.toList());
        }
    }

    return existing;
}
```
--

== Extracting from Streams - forEach and method handles

[.em065]
--
```java
private void parseStartJobsOutput(String startJobsOutput,
                                  Subscriber<Long> jobIdSub) {
    // the output from starting a job looks like "[123,125]"
    val matcher = JOB_IDS_PATTERN.matcher(startJobsOutput);
    if (matcher.matches()) {
        val jobIdsStr = (@NonNull String)matcher.group("jobIds");
        Arrays.stream(jobIdsStr.split(",")).
            map(String::trim).
            map(Long::valueOf).
            forEach(jobId -> jobIdSub.onNext(jobId));
        jobIdSub.onComplete();
    }
    else {
        jobIdSub.onError(new IllegalStateException("Could not parse job " +
            "ids from: " + startJobsOutput));
    }
}
```

== Venkat Talks Lambdas

image::venkat_lambdas.png[]

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OpAgZvYXLQ[Get a Taste of Lambdas and Get Addicted to Streams]
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4MT_OguDKg[Design Patterns in the Light of Lambda Expressions]

== Useful Stream Creation Classes

== java.util.Collection

[.em08]
--
```java
default Stream<E> stream() {
    return StreamSupport.stream(spliterator(), false);
}

default Stream<E> parallelStream() {
    return StreamSupport.stream(spliterator(), true);
}
```
--

* Everything that implements `Collection` automatically has `Stream` support.
* A `Spliterator` is an `Iterator` that can be decomposed (useful for parallel iteration).

== java.util.stream.StreamSupport

A set of factory methods that take take a `Spliterator` (of different types,
including for primitives) to create a `Stream`.

== java.util.Arrays

Has `.spliterator(..)` and `.stream(..)` factory methods to wrap arrays.

== java.util.stream.Collectors

A set of functions for

* collecting the values emitted by a Stream into collections like `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and `String`
* doing common aggregations, like counts, sums, min, max, average, "`reducing`", grouping, etc.

== Where's Elvis?

== java.util.Optional

```java
val existing = entries().stream().
    filter(e -> match(e, entry)).
    findAny().orElse(null);
```

== Still Not Quite Groovy's Elvis...

```groovy
public String getIssuesUrl() {
    return issuesUrl ?: "${siteUrl}/issues"
}
```

```java
public String getIssuesUrl() {
    return (issuesUrl != null && !issuesUrl.isEmpty()) ?
        issues : "${siteUrl}/issues"
}
```

== Try Again

[.em8]
--
```java
/**
 * Convert the String into an Optional that only has value if the
 * input was both non-null and non-empty.
 */
public static Optional<String> opt(String val) {
    return Optional.ofNullable(val).filter(s -> !s.isEmpty());
}

public String getIssuesUrl() {
    return opt(issuesUrl).orElseGet(() -> getSiteUrl() + "/issues");
}

public String getBintrayPkg() {
    return opt(bintrayPkg).orElse(project.getName());
}
```
--

== Optional vs Groovy's `?:` and `?.`

Groovy's elvis and null-safe-dereference operators are a very succinct way of
handling a very common situation in Java. But they are very specialized.

== !Optional

Because https://dzone.com/articles/whats-wrong-java-8-part-iv[`Optional` is
a monad] (though https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/08/optional-broken/[not
_entirely_ pure]) there is much, much more that you can do with it.

== !Optional

`Optional` is great if you treat it as a monad instead of simply a
null-wrapper (i.e., you should almost never call `.isPresent()` and `.get()`).

http://reversecoding.net/java-8-optional-replace-get-examples/


== Misc JDK8

* Default interface methods allowed adding a lot of extremely useful functions
  to the standard JDK classes without breaking everyone
  ** e.g., `Collection.stream()`
* `java.util.Map` added a lot of great methods, such as `getOrDefault(..)`,
  `putIfAbsent(..)`, `computeIfPresent(..)`, etc.
* http://www.mscharhag.com/java/java-8-date-time-api[The new DateTime API
  is really, really nice]. icon:thumbs-o-up[]
** May `java.util.Date`/`Calendar` be damned for
  all eternity. icon:thumbs-down[]
* Type Annotations allow you to put annotations on types anywhere a type
  declaration can appear, including local variables and type casts


== Softened Throws

== The Problem With Checked Exceptions

Often we don't want to expose underlying checked exceptions in our APIs, or
it's not our API to change (e.g., the Stream API).

[.smaller]
(We'll look later at an easy way of returning errors that aren't "`exceptional.`")

== Ignoring the Exception for Now...

Assuming there isn't anything reasonable to do with the exception at that point
in the code, that means we end up either swallowing or wrapping the exception.

[.smaller]
(Of course many JVM languages simply ignore the checked nature of exceptions,
but I'm focussing on the Java Language.)

== Wrapping Exceptions

[.em05]
--
```java
try {
    // ...
}
catch (IOException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
```
--

The exception that gets thrown is, well, *_wrong_*.

To get to the *_actual_* exception you have to call `.getCause()`.

== !Checked Exception

What would be great is if we can be unchecked and unwrapped...

== !Checked Exception

Generics type erasure to the rescue!

== Softened Exception

[.em05]
--
```java
/**
 * Remove checked-ness from the exception. The same exception is returned
 * (checked or unchecked), but this removes the compiler's checks.
 */
public static <T extends Throwable> RuntimeException softened(T exp) {
    return Utils.<RuntimeException>uncheck(exp);
}

private static <T extends Throwable> T uncheck(Throwable throwable) throws T {
    throw (T)throwable;
}
```
--

[.em05]
--
```java
protected void writeFile() {
    Writer fileWriter = null;
    try {
        // ...
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
        throw softened(e);
    }
    finally {
        Utils.flushAndClose(fileWriter);
    }
}
```
--


== Checker Framework

http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html

== !Checker Intro

[.fullheight]
image::checker-intro.png[]

== Nullness Checker

It hooks into `javac` and makes it extremely difficult to get an NPE.

There's no runtime component/impact, besides safer code.

== @NonNull

By default every parameter, field, variable, return value, etc. is effectively
marked as `@NonNull`

Doing anything that may potentially cause the reference to be `null` (including
not explicitly initializing it) causes a compile-time error

== @Nullable

If you mark a reference as being `@Nullable` then it will be a compile-time
error to dereference it unless a prior nullness check (e.g.,
`if (myVar != null)` ) guarantees that the execution branch can not be
`null`.

== Much Safer Code

I'm pretty good about making sure I don't get an NPE, but this has saved me a
few times.

Also, because it does the flow-analysis, it highlights execution branches you
might not have thought of.

== Better Use of the Type System

It's very much like static typing (which is what it's leveraging).

Sometimes it's useful to be "`loosely typed`" (or not explicitly nullness
checked), but most of the time it's much better to let the computer be
anal-retentive.

== It's Not Free

Of course the more the compiler has to do, the longer the compiler takes.

In general it's an easy call that spending a little more time compiling is
worth it to get the additional safety and "`correctness`" checking.

== Tutorial

See https://github.com/glts/safer-spring-petclinic/wiki/Our-mission

(a wizard-y wiki walking through the classic PetClinic sample)

for a good walk-through


== Either<L, R>

== !Disjoint Types

There are times when you need to be able to return one of two types that have no reasonable common ancestor (i.e., they are "`disjoint`" types).

== !Disjoint

What that often means is returning `Object` and then a series of `instanceof` calls.

== !Either interface

[.em07]
--
```java
/**
 * An either/or (XOR) value represented as Left/Right.
 *
 * By convention, Left is an error value whereas Right is a success value.
 */
public interface Either<L, R> extends Supplier<R> {
    boolean isLeft();

    L getLeft();

    boolean isRight();

    R get();

    static <L, R> Left<L, R> left(L value) {
        return new Left<>(value);
    }

    static <L, R> Right<L, R> right(R value) {
        return new Right<>(value);
    }
    // ...
}
```
--

== Example Either Return

[.em08]
--
```java
final class CliOptions {
    /**
     * Parse the arguments.
     *
     * @param args the command line arguments
     * @return Right if successfully parsed; otherwise Left with
     *         the error message/help
     */
    public static Either<String, CliOptions> create(String[] args) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
--

== !Example Either Use

[.em08]
--
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    val cliOptions = CliOptions.create(args);

    if (cliOptions.isRight()) {
        run(cliOptions.get());
        System.exit(0);
    }
    else {
        System.err.println(cliOptions.getLeft());
        System.exit(1);
    }
}
```

== !Either Credit

Grabbit CLI uses a much simplified version of `Either` based
on the work in http://www.javaslang.io/[Javaslang], a really awesome library
that helps with Scala-envy.

[.smaller]
(Didn't want to include Javaslang in the fat-jar for that single class.)

== Reactive Streams

http://www.reactive-streams.org/

== The Basics

Similar to `java.util.Stream` juiced **WAAAAAAAAY** up.

Three core simple interfaces that enable the capabilities of

http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/[The Reactive Manifesto]

Will be a core part of JDK 9 as
http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html[java.util.concurrent.Flow.*]

== The Interfaces

* *Publisher<T>* - A `Publisher` is a provider of a potentially unbounded number of sequenced elements, publishing them according to the demand received from its `Subscriber`(s).
* *Subscriber<T>* - Receives callbacks when a `Subscription` is created, data is ready from the `Publisher`, data is complete, or there is an error.
* *Subscription* - A `Subscription` represents a one-to-one lifecycle of a `Subscriber` subscribing to a `Publisher`.

With a forth "`combo`" interface:

* *Processor<T,R>* - A `Processor` represents a processing stageâwhich is both a `Subscriber` and a `Publisher` and obeys the contracts of both.

== !Processor

[.em08]
--
```java
public interface Processor<T, R> extends Subscriber<T>, Publisher<R> {
}
```
--

* This is the "`glue`" of the system
* Receives data as a `Subscriber`, transforms it, then sends it back out as a `Publisher`.
* Virtually all actions in a sequence are implemented as a `Processor`.

== Implementations

The primary implementations are:

* https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava] - primarily built by NetFlix
  based on Microsoft's pioneering "`Reactive Extensions`" work; widely deployed
  and very battle-tested
* http://projectreactor.io/[Project Reactor] - primarily built by Pivotal, it
  largely focusses on being "`lean and mean`"
* http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.8/scala/stream/index.html[Akka Streams] -
  primarily built by Lightbend for Scala, it's the most "`full stack`" system

== Project Reactor

* Pre-v2.5 looked a lot like RxJava with some new ideas.
* v2.5+ takes full advantage of JDK8+ and is going to be the foundation of
  the "`reactive`" changes in Spring Framework v5.

== !Flux and Mono

For our purposes, the primary classes are `Flux` and `Mono`, both of which implement `Publisher`

== !Flux and Mono

* Add useful methods, such as `map(..)`, `flatMap(..)`, `filter(..)`, etc.
* Support back-pressure, hot & cold streams, etc.

== Mono

Will publish *_at most_* one element.

Essentially a very, very fancy `java.util.Optional`.

Provides `.block(..)` to do the "`extraction.`"

== Flux

More like `java.util.stream.Stream`, with no limit on size.

== Example - Starting Jobs

[.em08]
--
```java
/**
 * Start the jobs on the Grabbit clients, returning the hosts
 * and the jobs ids.
 */
public Publisher<HostAndJobIds> startJobs() {
    return Flux.fromIterable(hosts).
        map(this::startJobsForHost);
}

private HostAndJobIds startJobsForHost(HostInfo hostInfo) {
    Publisher<Long> jobIds = startJobsOnHost(hostInfo.baseUri(),
                                             hostInfo.credentials());
    return new HostAndJobIds(hostInfo.baseUri(), jobIds);
}
```
--

== Example - Consuming the Started Jobs

[.em08]
--
```java
/**
 * Print the started jobs to the PrintStream, waiting up to 30
 * minutes for the jobs to finish starting across all the hosts.
 */
static void printStartedJobs(Publisher<HostAndJobIds> startedJobs,
                             PrintStream out) {
    Flux.from(startedJobs).
        flatMap(GrabbitCli::hostAndJobIdsToStrings).
        doOnNext(out::println).
        then().block(Duration.ofMinutes(30));
}
```

== Example - Processor and Subscriber

[.em05]
--
```java
/**
 * Start a process on {@link #executorService} that connects to the Grabbit client at `baseUri` and
 * publishes the job ids.
 */
private Publisher<Long> startJobsOnHost(final URI baseUri, UsernameAndPassword credentials) {
    final Processor<Long, Long> processor = WorkQueueProcessor.share(executorService);
    executorService.execute(() -> startJobsOnHostWithSubscriber(processor, baseUri, credentials));
    return processor;
}

private void startJobsOnHostWithSubscriber(Subscriber<Long> jobIdSubscriber, URI baseUri,
                                           UsernameAndPassword credentials) {
    // ...
}

private void parseStartJobsOutput(String startJobsOutput, Subscriber<Long> jobIdSub) {
    // the output from starting a job looks like "[123,125]"
    val matcher = JOB_IDS_PATTERN.matcher(startJobsOutput);
    if (matcher.matches()) {
        val jobIdsStr = (@NonNull String)matcher.group("jobIds");
        Arrays.stream(jobIdsStr.split(",")).
            map(String::trim).
            map(Long::valueOf).
            forEach(jobId -> jobIdSub.onNext(jobId));
        jobIdSub.onComplete();
    }
    else {
        jobIdSub.onError(new IllegalStateException("Could not parse job ids from: " + startJobsOutput));
    }
}

[.em07]
--
* You only need to set `ExecutorService` *_or_* `Environment`, but at least
  one of them must be set.
* `JobStatusCache` is required, but `JobStatusPoller` and `sleep` are optional.
* If `build()` is called without all the requirements being met, it throws an
  `IllegalStateException`.

```java
public static B.WithJobStatusCache builder() {
    return new B.Builder();
}
public interface B { // namespacing
    class Builder implements Build, ExecutorOrEnvironment, WithJobStatusCache {
        //... virtually identical to before
    }
    interface Build {
        PollingJobMonitor build();
        Build poller(JobStatusPoller jobStatusPoller);
        Build sleep(long sleepMs);

* The type system is acting as a compile-time state machine, ensuring that it's
  **impossible** to call `build()` in a bad state.

== Static Analysis ("`Linting`")

== Primary Java Linters

* PMD
** https://pmd.github.io/
** Source code analyzer looking for unused/overly-complex code, copy & paste, etc.
* CheckStyle
** http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/
** Source code analyzer focussed on coding standards.
* FindBugs
** http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/
** Byte-code analyzer. Especially useful for the kinds of bugs that are
easier to detect in compiled form.

== !Overlap

There's a great deal of overlap between them.

They have different strengths/focusses, so use all three.
